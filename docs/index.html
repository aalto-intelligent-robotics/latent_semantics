                Visual-language models (VLMs) have recently been introduced in robotic mapping using the latent representations,
                i.e., embeddings, of the VLMs to represent semantics in the map. They allow moving from a limited set of
                human-created labels toward open-vocabulary scene understanding, which is very useful for robots when operating in
                complex real-world environments and interacting with humans. While there is anecdotal evidence that maps built this
                way support downstream tasks, such as navigation, rigorous analysis of the quality of the maps using these
                embeddings is missing.
                In this paper, we propose a way to analyze the quality of maps created using VLMs. We investigate two critical
                properties of map quality: queryability and distinctness. The evaluation of queryability addresses the ability to
                retrieve information from the embeddings. We investigate intra-map distinctness to study the ability of the
                embeddings to represent abstract semantic classes and inter-map distinctness to evaluate the generalization
                properties of the representation.
                We propose metrics to evaluate these properties and evaluate two state-of-the-art mapping methods, VLMaps and
                OpenScene, using two encoders, LSeg and OpenSeg, using real-world data from the Matterport3D data set. Our findings
                show that while 3D features improve queryability, they are not scale invariant, whereas image-based embeddings
                generalize to multiple map resolutions. This allows the image-based methods to maintain smaller map sizes, which can
                be crucial for using these methods in real-world deployments. Furthermore, we show that the choice of the encoder
                has an effect on the results. The results imply that properly thresholding open-vocabulary queries is an open
                problem.
